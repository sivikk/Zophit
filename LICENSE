                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       ersion 3, 29 June 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
 Eeryone is permitted to copy and distribute erbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works.

  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all ersions of a programto make sure it remains free
software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
hae the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
them if you wish), that you receie source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to preent others from denying you
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you hae
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
freedoms that you receied.  You must make sure that they, too, receie
or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
know their rights.

  Deelopers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
giing you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

  For the deelopers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified ersions be marked as
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
authors of preious ersions.

  Some deices are designed to deny users access to install or run
modified ersions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic
pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for indiiduals to
use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we
hae designed this ersion of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
stand ready to extend this proision to those domains in future ersions
of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.

  Finally, eery program is threatened constantly by software patents.
States should not allow patents to restrict deelopment and use of
software on generalpurpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
aoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
make it effectiely proprietary.  To preent this, the GPL assures that
patents cannot be used to render the program nonfree.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS

  0. Definitions.

  "This License" refers to ersion 3 of the GNU General Public License.

  "Copyright" also means copyrightlike laws that apply to other kinds of
works, such as semiconductor masks.

  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
"recipients" may be indiiduals or organizations.

  To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified ersion" of the
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

  A "coered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
on the Program.

  To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
computer or modifying a priate copy.  Propagation includes copying,
distribution (with or without modification), making aailable to the
public, and in some countries other actiities as well.

  To "coney" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
parties to make or receie copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not coneying.

  An interactie user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
to the extent that it includes a conenient and prominently isible
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
extent that warranties are proided), that licensees may coney the
work under this License, and how to iew a copy of this License.  If
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.

  1. Source Code.

  The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any nonsource
form of a work.

  A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
is widely used among deelopers working in that language.

  The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
Component, and (b) seres only to enable use of the work with that
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
implementation is aailable to the public in source code form.  A
"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.

  The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
control those actiities.  Howeer, it does not include the work's
System Libraries, or generalpurpose tools or generally aailable free
programs which are used unmodified in performing those actiities but
which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
includes interface definition files associated with source files for
the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
subprograms and other parts of the work.

  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
Source.

  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
same work.

  2. Basic Permissions.

  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
copyright on the Program, and are irreocable proided the stated
conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
coered work is coered by this License only if the output, gien its
content, constitutes a coered work.  This License acknowledges your
rights of fair use or other equialent, as proided by copyright law.

  You may make, run and propagate coered works that you do not
coney, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
in force.  You may coney coered works to others for the sole purpose
of haing them make modifications exclusiely for you, or proide you
with facilities for running those works, proided that you comply with
the terms of this License in coneying all material for which you do
not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the coered works
for you must do so exclusiely on your behalf, under your direction
and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.

  Coneying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
makes it unnecessary.

  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From AntiCircumention Law.

  No coered work shall be deemed part of an effectie technological
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumention of such
measures.

  When you coney a coered work, you waie any legal power to forbid
circumention of technological measures to the extent such circumention
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
the coered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumention of
technological measures.

  4. Coneying erbatim Copies.

  You may coney erbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
receie it, in any medium, proided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
nonpermissie terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and gie all
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you coney,
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

  5. Coneying Modified Source ersions.

  You may coney a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
terms of section 4, proided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
    it, and giing a releant date.

    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
    released under this License and any conditions added under section
    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
    "keep intact all notices".

    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gies no
    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
    inalidate such permission if you hae separately receied it.

    d) If the work has interactie user interfaces, each must display
    Appropriate Legal Notices; howeer, if the Program has interactie
    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
    work need not make them do so.

  A compilation of a coered work with other separate and independent
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the coered work,
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
in or on a olume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
beyond what the indiidual works permit.  Inclusion of a coered work
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
parts of the aggregate.

  6. Coneying NonSource Forms.

  You may coney a coered work in object code form under the terms
of sections 4 and 5, proided that you also coney the
machinereadable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
in one of these ways:

    a) Coney the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
    customarily used for software interchange.

    b) Coney the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
    written offer, alid for at least three years and alid for as
    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
    model, to gie anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
    product that is coered by this License, on a durable physical
    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
    coneying of source, or (2) access to copy the
    Corresponding Source from a network serer at no charge.

    c) Coney indiidual copies of the object code with a copy of the
    written offer to proide the Corresponding Source.  This
    alternatie is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
    only if you receied the object code with such an offer, in accord
    with subsection 6b.

    d) Coney the object code by offering access from a designated
    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equialent access to the
    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
    copy the object code is a network serer, the Corresponding Source
    may be on a different serer (operated by you or a third party)
    that supports equialent copying facilities, proided you maintain
    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what serer hosts the
    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
    aailable for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.

    e) Coney the object code using peertopeer transmission, proided
    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
    charge under subsection 6d.

  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
included in coneying the object code work.

  A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
doubtful cases shall be resoled in faor of coerage.  For a particular
product receied by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a
typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
commercial, industrial or nonconsumer uses, unless such uses represent
the only significant mode of use of the product.

  "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
and execute modified ersions of a coered work in that User Product from
a modified ersion of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
code is in no case preented or interfered with solely because
modification has been made.

  If you coney an object code work under this section in, or with, or
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the coneying occurs as
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
Corresponding Source coneyed under this section must be accompanied
by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
been installed in ROM).

  The requirement to proide Installation Information does not include a
requirement to continue to proide support serice, warranty, or updates
for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
adersely affects the operation of the network or iolates the rules and
protocols for communication across the network.

  Corresponding Source coneyed, and Installation Information proided,
in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
documented (and with an implementation aailable to the public in
source code form), and must require no special password or key for
unpacking, reading or copying.

  7. Additional Terms.

  "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
that they are alid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains goerned by
this License without regard to the additional permissions.

  When you coney a copy of a coered work, you may at your option
remoe any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
remoal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
additional permissions on material, added by you to a coered work,
for which you hae or can gie appropriate copyright permission.

  Notwithstanding any other proision of this License, for material you
add to a coered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:

    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or

    b) Requiring preseration of specified reasonable legal notices or
    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
    Notices displayed by works containing it; or

    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
    requiring that modified ersions of such material be marked in
    reasonable ways as different from the original ersion; or

    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
    authors of the material; or

    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
    trade names, trademarks, or serice marks; or

    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
    material by anyone who coneys the material (or modified ersions of
    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
    those licensors and authors.

  All other nonpermissie additional terms are considered "further
restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
receied it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
goerned by this License along with a term that is a further
restriction, you may remoe that term.  If a license document contains
a further restriction but permits relicensing or coneying under this
License, you may add to a coered work material goerned by the terms
of that license document, proided that the further restriction does
not surie such relicensing or coneying.

  If you add terms to a coered work in accord with this section, you
must place, in the releant source files, a statement of the
additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
where to find the applicable terms.

  Additional terms, permissie or nonpermissie, may be stated in the
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
the aboe requirements apply either way.

  8. Termination.

  You may not propagate or modify a coered work except as expressly
proided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
modify it is oid, and will automatically terminate your rights under
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
paragraph of section 11).

  Howeer, if you cease all iolation of this License, then your
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
proisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
holder fails to notify you of the iolation by some reasonable means
prior to 60 days after the cessation.

  Moreoer, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
iolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you hae
receied notice of iolation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the iolation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.

  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who hae receied copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights hae been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, you do not qualify to receie new licenses for the same
material under section 10.

  9. Acceptance Not Required for Haing Copies.

  You are not required to accept this License in order to receie or
run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a coered work
occurring solely as a consequence of using peertopeer transmission
to receie a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  Howeer,
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
modify any coered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
coered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.

  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

  Each time you coney a coered work, the recipient automatically
receies a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

  An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdiiding an
organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a coered
work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
transaction who receies a copy of the work also receies whateer
licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
gie under the preious paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.

  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
(including a crossclaim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.

  11. Patents.

  A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor ersion".

  A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor ersion,
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
consequence of further modification of the contributor ersion.  For
purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
this License.

  Each contributor grants you a nonexclusie, worldwide, royaltyfree
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
propagate the contents of its contributor ersion.

  In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
agreement or commitment, howeer denominated, not to enforce a patent
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or coenant not to
sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
patent against the party.

  If you coney a coered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not aailable for anyone
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
publicly aailable network serer or other readily accessible means,
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
aailable, or (2) arrange to deprie yourself of the benefit of the
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you hae
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your coneying the
coered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the coered work
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
country that you hae reason to beliee are alid.

  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
arrangement, you coney, or propagate by procuring coneyance of, a
coered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
receiing the coered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
or coney a specific copy of the coered work, then the patent license
you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the coered
work and works based on it.

  A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within
the scope of its coerage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
conditioned on the nonexercise of one or more of the rights that are
specifically granted under this License.  You may not coney a coered
work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
to the third party based on the extent of your actiity of coneying
the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
parties who would receie the coered work from you, a discriminatory
patent license (a) in connection with copies of the coered work
coneyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
contain the coered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.

  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
otherwise be aailable to you under applicable patent law.

  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot coney a
coered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
not coney it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
to collect a royalty for further coneying from those to whom you coney
the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
License would be to refrain entirely from coneying the Program.

  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.

  Notwithstanding any other proision of this License, you hae
permission to link or combine any coered work with a work licensed
under ersion 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single
combined work, and to coney the resulting work.  The terms of this
License will continue to apply to the part which is the coered work,
but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,
section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the
combination as such.

  14. Reised ersions of this License.

  The Free Software Foundation may publish reised and/or new ersions of
the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new ersions will
be similar in spirit to the present ersion, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

  Each ersion is gien a distinguishing ersion number.  If the
Program specifies that a certain numbered ersion of the GNU General
Public License "or any later ersion" applies to it, you hae the
option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
ersion or of any later ersion published by the Free Software
Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a ersion number of the
GNU General Public License, you may choose any ersion eer published
by the Free Software Foundation.

  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
ersions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's
public statement of acceptance of a ersion permanently authorizes you
to choose that ersion for the Program.

  Later license ersions may gie you additional or different
permissions.  Howeer, no additional obligations are imposed on any
author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
later ersion.

  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.

  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROE DEFECTIE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
ALL NECESSARY SERICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. Limitation of Liability.

  IN NO EENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONEYS
THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
EEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
SUCH DAMAGES.

  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability proided
aboe cannot be gien local legal effect according to their terms,
reiewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
an absolute waier of all ciil liability in connection with the
Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
copy of the Program in return for a fee.

                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you deelop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achiee this is to make it
free software which eeryone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectiely
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should hae at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to gie the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify

    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands
might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box".
